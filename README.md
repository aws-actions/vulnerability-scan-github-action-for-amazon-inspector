# Vulnerability Scan GitHub Action for Amazon Inspector

Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that scans AWS workloads
and [CycloneDX SBOMs](https://cyclonedx.org/) for known software vulnerabilities.

This GitHub Action allows you to scan supported artifacts for software vulnerabilities using Amazon Inspector from your
GitHub Actions workflows.

An active AWS account is required to use this action.

## Overview

This action works by first generating a CycloneDX software bill of materials (SBOM) for the provided artifact.

The SBOM is then sent to Amazon Inspector; Inspector scans the provided SBOM for known vulnerabilities, and returns its
results to the calling action.

This action can scan the following artifact types for software vulnerabilities:

1. Files and directories in your GitHub repository
2. Container images
3. Compiled Go and Rust binaries (*stripped and obfuscated binaries are not supported*)
4. Archives *(.zip, .tar, .tar.gz)*

To learn more about this action's supported artifacts, please see our documentation
here: [Amazon Inspector SBOM Generator (inspector-sbomgen)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/sbom-generator.html)
.

## Prerequisites

1. **Required:** You must have an active AWS account to use this action. Guidance on creating an AWS account is
   provided [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/configure-cicd-account.html).

2. **Required:** You must have read access to the **InspectorScan:ScanSbom**
   API. [See here for configuration instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/configure-cicd-account.html#cicd-iam-role)
   .

3. **Required:** You must configure AWS authentication for use in GitHub action workflows. We recommend
   using [configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-action-for-github-actions)
   for this purpose.

4. **Required:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow if you do not already have one. Guidance on doing so is
   available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).

5. **Required:** Configure Dependabot to keep this action up to date so you receive the latest bug fixes and security
   updates. Guidance on doing so is
   available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot#enabling-dependabot-version-updates-for-actions)
   .

6. *Optional:* Configure container registry authentication if needed. GitHub Actions are available for this purpose
   including [Docker Login](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-login).

## Usage

### Quick Start

Perform the following steps to quickly add this action to your GitHub Actions pipeline:

1. Copy and paste the following YAML block into your workflow file.

   **Read through this workflow definition and make changes to suit your environment**:

    ```yaml
   name: Scan artifact with Amazon Inspector
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     daily_job:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       
       # change this to match your GitHub Secrets environment
       environment:
         name: your_github_secrets_environment
   
       steps:
   
         # modify this block based on how you authenticate to AWS
         # make sure you have permission to access the Inspector ScanSbom API
         # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/configure-cicd-account.html#cicd-iam-role
         - name: Configure AWS credentials
           uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
           with:
             aws-region: "us-east-1"
             role-to-assume: "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<IAM_ROLE_NAME>"
   
         # Check out your repository if needed
         - name: Checkout this repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
   
         # modify this block to scan your intended artifact
         - name: Inspector Scan
           id: inspector
           uses: aws-actions/vulnerability-scan-github-action-for-amazon-inspector@v1
           with:
             # change artifact_type to either 'repository', 'container', 'binary', or 'archive'.
             artifact_type: 'repository'
   
             # change artifact_path to the file path or container image you would like to scan.
             # File paths should be relative to your root project directory.
             # For containers, this action accepts 'docker pull'-style references to containers,
             # such as 'alpine:latest' or a file path to an image exported as TAR using docker save.
             artifact_path: './'
   
             # If enabled, this setting will display Inspector's vulnerability scan findings
             # as a GitHub actions step summary. See here for an example step summary:
             # https://github.com/aws-actions/vulnerability-scan-github-action-for-amazon-inspector/actions/runs/8800085041
             display_vulnerability_findings: "enabled"
   
             # Set vulnerability thresholds; if the number of vulnerabilities is
             # equal to or greater than any of the specified thresholds, this
             # action will set the 'vulnerability_threshold_exceeded'
             # output flag to 1.
             critical_threshold: 1
             high_threshold: 1
             medium_threshold: 1
             low_threshold: 1
             other_threshold: 1
   
             # Additional input arguments are available to control scan behavior.
             # See 'action.yml' for additional input/output options.
   
   
         # The following steps illustrate how to 
         # display scan results in the GitHub Actions job terminal.
         - name: Display CycloneDX SBOM (JSON)
           run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.artifact_sbom }}
   
         - name: Display Inspector vulnerability scan results (JSON)
           run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results }}
   
         - name: Display Inspector vulnerability scan results (CSV)
           run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results_csv }}
   
         - name: Display Inspector vulnerability scan results (Markdown)
           run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results_markdown }}
   
   
         # The following steps illustrate how to 
         # upload scan results as a GitHub actions job artifact
         - name: Upload Scan Results
           uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
           with:
             name: Inspector Vulnerability Scan Artifacts
             path: |
               ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results }}
               ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results_csv }}
               ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.artifact_sbom }}
               ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results_markdown }}
   
   
           # This step illustrates how to add custom logic if
           # the vulnerability threshold is exceeded. This example
           # simply prints the 'vulnerability_threshold_exceeded' value
           # to the GitHub actions job terminal.
           # Replace 'echo' with 'exit' if you want to fail the job.
         - name: On vulnerability threshold exceeded
           run: echo ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.vulnerability_threshold_exceeded }}
    ```

2. Save your workflow file then git commit / git push the workflow to GitHub.

GitHub should automatically run your new workflow; review its results and make any needed changes to the input and
output arguments.

For additional examples, see [this repository's workflow definitions](.github/workflows/).

### Configuring Vulnerability Scan Outputs

This action provides detailed Inspector scan findings in JSON, CSV, and markdown, plus, a CycloneDX software bill of
materials in JSON.

By default, this action will only display the number of vulnerabilities detected in the GitHub Actions job terminal;
detailed vulnerability findings are not shown.

This is done so **you** can control how and where your vulnerability findings are presented and stored.

The example below shows how to present this action's outputs in various locations and formats.

Exercise caution to ensure you do not accidentally post vulnerability information to untrusted viewers.

```yaml
- name: Scan container
  id: inspector
  uses: aws/vulnerability-scan-github-action-for-amazon-inspector@v1
  with:
    artifact_type: 'container'
    artifact_path: 'ubuntu:14.04'
    display_vulnerability_findings: "enabled"

# Display Inspector results in the GitHub Actions terminal
- name: Display CycloneDX SBOM (JSON)
  run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.artifact_sbom }}

- name: Display Inspector vulnerability scan results (JSON)
  run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results }}

- name: Display Inspector vulnerability scan results (CSV)
  run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results_csv }}

- name: Display Inspector vulnerability scan results (markdown)
  run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results_markdown }}


# Upload Inspector outputs as a .zip that can be downloaded
# from the GitHub actions job summary page.
- name: Upload Scan Results
  id: inspector
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
  path: |
    ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results }}
    ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results_csv }}
    ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.artifact_sbom }}
```

### Configuring Vulnerability Thresholds

This action allows the user to set vulnerability thresholds.

Vulnerability thresholds can be used to support custom logic, such as failing the workflow if any vulnerabilities are
found.

The example below shows how to set up vulnerability thresholds and fail the job when the threshold is exceeded:

```yaml
- name: Invoke Amazon Inspector Scan
  id: inspector
  uses: aws/vulnerability-scan-github-action-for-amazon-inspector@v1
  with:
    artifact_type: 'repository'
    artifact_path: './'
    display_vulnerability_findings: "enabled"

    # If the number of vulnerabilities equals or exceeds
    # any of the specified vulnerability thresholds, this action
    # sets a flag, 'vulnerability_threshold_exceeded' to 1, else 0.
    # To ignore thresholds for a given severity, set its value to 0.
    # This example sets 'vulnerability_threshold_exceeded' flag if
    # one or more criticals, highs, or medium severity vulnerabilities
    # are found; lows and other type vulnerabilities will not set
    # the 'vulnerability_threshold_exceeded' flag.
    critical_threshold: 1
    high_threshold: 1
    medium_threshold: 1
    low_threshold: 0
    other_threshold: 0

# Fail the job with 'exit 1' if vuln threshold flag is set
- name: On vulnerability threshold exceeded
  run: exit ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.vulnerability_threshold_exceeded }}
```

### Build and Scan Container Images

This action supports a common use case that entails building a container image, scanning the built image for
vulnerabilities, and optionally, failing the workflow before the image is deployed to a container registry or elsewhere.

We provide an example of this workflow below; you must modify this workflow to suit your environment:

```yaml
name: Build & Scan Container Image

on: [ push ]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build docker image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      # change this to match your GitHub secrets environment
      name: plugin-development

    steps:
      # checkout the repository containing our Dockerfile
      - name: Checkout this repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Setup prerequisites for docker/build-push-action
      - name: Set up docker build prereqs (QEMU)
        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v3

      - name: Set up docker build prereqs (Buildx)
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      # build the image you wish to scan
      - name: Build Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Dockerfile
          push: false
          tags: app:latest
          load: true

      # setup your AWS credentials
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          aws-region: "us-east-1"
          role-to-assume: "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<IAM_ROLE_NAME>"

      - name: Scan built image with Inspector
        uses: aws/amazon-inspector-github-actions-plugin@v1
        id: inspector
        with:
          artifact_type: 'container'
          artifact_path: 'app:latest' # make sure this matches the image you built
          critical_threshold: 1
          high_threshold: 1
          medium_threshold: 1
          low_threshold: 1
          other_threshold: 1
          # set additional arguments as needed

      - name: Fail job if vulnerability threshold is exceeded
        run: exit ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.vulnerability_threshold_exceeded }}

        # add any additional steps for deploying your image
```
