# Vulnerability Scan GitHub Action for Amazon Inspector

Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that scans AWS workloads and [CycloneDX SBOMs](https://cyclonedx.org/) for known software vulnerabilities.

This GitHub Action allows you to scan supported artifacts for software vulnerabilities using Amazon Inspector.

An active AWS account is required to use this action.


## Overview

This action can detect software vulnerabilities in the following artifact types within your GitHub Actions workflows:

1. Package dependencies
2. Container images
3. Compiled Go and Rust binaries
4. Archives *(.zip, .tar, .tar.gz)*

To learn more about this action's supported artifacts, please see our documentation here: [Amazon Inspector SBOM Generator (inspector-sbomgen)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/sbom-generator.html).


## Prerequisites

1. **Required:** You must have an active AWS account to use this action. Guidance on creating an AWS account is provided [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/configure-cicd-account.html).

2. **Required:** You must have read access to the **InspectorScan:ScanSbom** API. [See here for configuration instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/configure-cicd-account.html#cicd-iam-role).

3. **Required:** You must configure AWS authentication for use in GitHub action workflows. We recommend using [configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-action-for-github-actions) for this purpose.

4. **Required:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow if you do not already have one. Guidance on doing so is available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).

5. **Required:** Configure Dependabot to keep this action up to date so you receive the latest bug fixes and security updates. Guidance on doing so is available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot#enabling-dependabot-version-updates-for-actions). 

6. *Optional:* Configure container registry authentication if needed. GitHub Actions are available for this purpose including [Docker Login](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-login).


## Usage

### Quick Start

Perform the following steps to quickly add this action to your GitHub Actions pipeline:

1. Create a new workflow file in your repository:

```bash
# from your repository's root directory
touch .github/workflows/invoke_inspector_scan.yml
```

2. Copy and paste the following YAML block into your workflow file.

You will need to modify this workflow definition to suit your environment:

```yaml
TODO: paste me / link me
```

3. Save your workflow file then git commit / git push the workflow to GitHub.

GitHub should automatically run your new workflow; review its results and make any needed changes to the input and output arguments.


### Configuring Vulnerability Scan Outputs

This action provides detailed Inspector scan findings in JSON, CSV, and markdown, plus, a CycloneDX software bill of materials in JSON.

By default, this action will only display the number of vulnerabilities detected in the GitHub Actions job terminal; detailed findings are not shown.

This is done so **you** can control how and where your vulnerability findings are presented and stored.

The example below shows how to present this action's outputs in various locations and formats:

```yaml
- name: Scan container
  id: inspector
  uses: aws/vulnerability-scan-github-action-for-amazon-inspector@main
  with:
    artifact_type: 'container'
    artifact_path: 'ubuntu:14.04'

# Display Inspector results in the GitHub Actions terminal
- name: Display CycloneDX SBOM (JSON)
run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.artifact_sbom }}

- name: Display Inspector vulnerability scan results (JSON)
run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results }}

- name: Display Inspector vulnerability scan results (CSV)
run: cat ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results_csv }}


# Upload Inspector outputs as a .zip that can be downloaded
# from the GitHub actions job summary page.
- name: Upload Scan Results
  id: inspector
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
  name: Inspector Vulnerability Scan Artifacts
  path: |
    ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results }}
    ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.inspector_scan_results_csv }}
    ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.artifact_sbom }}
```

### Configuring Vulnerability Thresholds

This action allows the user to set vulnerability thresholds.

If the number of vulnerabilities found is greater than or equal to the provided vulnerability threshold, the `vulnerability_threshold_exceeded` output argument will be set to 1. If the vulnerability threshold is NOT exceeded, `vulnerability_threshold_exceeded` is set to 0. This can be used to setup custom logic when vulnerability thresholds are exceeded, such as failing the job to avoid publishing an artifact with known vulnerabilities.

The example below shows how to setup vulnerability thresholds and fail the job when the threshold is exceeded:

```yaml
- name: Invoke Amazon Inspector Scan
  id: inspector
  uses: aws/vulnerability-scan-github-action-for-amazon-inspector@v1
  with:
    artifact_type: 'repository'
    artifact_path: './'

    # set vulnerability thresholds
    critical_threshold: 1
    high_threshold: 1
    medium_threshold: 1
    low_threshold: 1
    other_threshold: 1

# Fail the job with 'exit 1' if vuln threshold is exceeded
- name: On vulnerability threshold exceeded
  run: exit ${{ steps.inspector.outputs.vulnerability_threshold_exceeded }}
```

### 1. Scan Package Dependencies

This example will scan your repository contents for vulnerable software packages, based on contents from files known to contain package information, such as Python's requirements.txt file.

```yaml
- name: Invoke Amazon Inspector Scan
  uses: aws/amazon-inspector-github-actions-plugin@v1
  with:
    artifact_type: 'repository'
    artifact_path: './' # change this if you would like to scan a specific sub-directory, otherwise the entire repo will be scanned.
```

- [*See here for more information on the types of package vulnerabilities this action can detect*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/sbom-generator.html).


### 2. Scan Container Image

This example will scan a container image for vulnerable software packages.

```yaml
- name: Invoke Amazon Inspector Scan
  uses: aws/amazon-inspector-github-actions-plugin@v1
  with:
    artifact_type: 'container'
    artifact_path: 'alpine:latest' # change this to the image you would like to scan
```

This action can scan containers exported as tarballs, locally built images, and images from remote registries.

For locally built images, this action only supports images built with Docker engine.

- [*See here for an example on building an image, scanning the image, and failing the build if vulnerabilities are detected*](./.github/workflows/container_local.yml).


### 3. Scan Compiled Go or Rust Binary

This example will scan a compiled Go or Rust binary's package dependencies for vulnerabiliies.

```yaml
- name: Invoke Amazon Inspector Scan
  uses: aws/amazon-inspector-github-actions-plugin@v1
  with:
    artifact_type: 'binary'
    artifact_path: './path/to/binary' # change this to your binary's filepath
```

### 4. Scan Archive

This example will scan an archive for vulnerable software packages. The supported archive formats are **.zip**, **.tar**, and **.tar.gz**.

```yaml
- name: Invoke Amazon Inspector Scan
  uses: aws/amazon-inspector-github-actions-plugin@v1
  with:
    artifact_type: 'archive'
    artifact_path: './path/to/archive' # change this to your archive's filepath
```

## Action Inputs and Outputs

The following input and output options are provided by this action; see [action.yml](./action.yml) for more detail.

| Option | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| artifact_type | **Yes** | The artifact you would like to scan with Amazon Inspector. Valid choices are "repository", "container", "binary", or "archive". |
| artifact_path | **Yes** | The path to the artifact you would like to scan with Amazon Inspector. If scanning a container image, you must provide a  value that follows the docker pull convention: "NAME[:TAG\|@DIGEST]", for example, "alpine:latest", or a path to an image exported as tarball using "docker save". |
| output_sbom_path | No | The destination file path for the generated SBOM. |
| output_inspector_scan_path | No | The destination file path for Inspector's vulnerability scan (JSON format). |
| output_inspector_scan_path_csv | No | The destination file path for Inspector's vulnerability scan (CSV format). |
| sbomgen_version | No | The inspector-sbomgen version you wish to use for SBOM generation. See [here for more info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/sbom-generator.html). |
| critical_threshold | No | Specifies the number of critical vulnerabilities to trigger job failure. |
| high_threshold | No | Specifies the number of high vulnerabilities to trigger job failure. |
| medium_threshold | No | Specifies the number of medium vulnerabilities to trigger job failure. |
| low_threshold | No | Specifies the number of low vulnerabilities to trigger job failure. |
| other_threshold | No | Specifies the number of 'other' vulnerabilities to trigger job failure, such as 'info', 'none', or 'unknown'. |
| scanners | No | Specifies the file scanners that you would like inspector-sbomgen to execute. By default, inspector-sbomgen will try to run all file scanners that are applicable to the target artifact. If this argument is set, inspector-sbomgen will only execute the specified file scanners. Provide your input as a single string. Separate each file scanner with a comma. To view a list of available file scanners, execute `inspector-sbomgen list-scanners`. [See here for more info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/sbom-generator.html). |
| skip_scanners | No | Specifies a list of file scanners that should NOT be executed; this argument cannot be combined with 'scanners'. If this argument is set, inspector-sbomgen will execute all file scanners except those you specified. Provide your input as a single string. Separate each file scanner with a comma. To view a list of available file scanners, execute `inspector-sbomgen list-scanners`. See [here for more info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/sbom-generator.html). |
| skip_files | No | Specifies one or more files and/or directories that should NOT be inventoried. Separate each file with a comma and enclose the entire string in double quotes. |
| timeout | No | Specifies a timeout in seconds. If this timeout is exceeded, the action will gracefully conclude and present any findings discovered up to that point. |

## Action Outputs
